Full Project Description for Cursor AI: Development of "EL DESPERTAR DEL AVATAR" Landing Page
Below is the complete project description and development instructions for the "EL DESPERTAR DEL AVATAR" landing page. This document includes all technical details, section-specific requirements, and branding guidelines to ensure a high-quality, conversion-optimized landing page.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a visually impactful, emotionally engaging, and conversion-focused landing page for the event "EL DESPERTAR DEL AVATAR". This event is a transformative ice immersion experience designed to help participants overcome fear, build resilience, and connect with their inner strength. The landing page must clearly communicate the event's value, address potential objections, and drive registrations.

The landing page will initially support manual payment instructions for bookings. Later, we will integrate a payment gateway to support Nequi, Bancolombia, and Daviplata transactions, as well as card payments. The page must be optimized for mobile and desktop users, load quickly, and include all necessary elements to maximize conversions.
The landing will be in Spanish only for now.
